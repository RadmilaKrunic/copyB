  Kick off intentional feature work with the full ticketed workflow: clarify
  scope, create a goal-oriented JIRA ticket, set up the branch, develop the
  solution, commit, and open a PR. Use this skill when the user says
  "start feature: X", "start a feature", "kick off work on X", or "full
  workflow for X". This is a deliberate mode the user enters — do NOT
  trigger for casual coding requests, experiments, spikes, or when the user
  just asks to "add X" or "implement X" without explicit feature framing.
  The phrase "start feature" is the signal.
---

# Start Feature Workflow

This skill orchestrates the full lifecycle of intentional feature work:
ticket → clarify → specify → plan → branch → develop → test → commit → review → PR → finalize.

It is designed to be entered deliberately. Experiments and spikes skip this
entirely — the user just codes. This workflow is for work that deserves a

## Project configuration

```
Tool: Read
file_path: .claude/skills/feature-workflow/config.json
```

Hold these values for use in Phase 1-pre and beyond:
- `<branchTypes>` ← `git.branchTypes` (array, e.g., `["feature","bugfix","hotfix"]`)
- `<branchPattern>` ← `git.branchPattern` (template, e.g., `"{type}/{ticket}-{slug}"`)

If the config is missing or invalid, stop and ask the user to populate it
before continuing — the workflow cannot create tickets or PRs without it.

Then read the shared switchboard once:

```
Tool: Read
file_path: .github/ai-workflow.yml
```

- `<baseBranch>` ← `project.baseBranch`. `lib.sh` `detect_main_branch` reads the same value; it falls back to `origin/HEAD` / `main` / `master` only when the file has none.
- `<branchPattern>` ← `project.branchPattern` (overrides `config.json`; both are kept equal).
- `<tracker>` ← resolve per `.github/skills/bass-integrations/SKILL.md` (`jira` | `azureDevOps` | `none`). `none` is a normal mode, not an error.
- `<reporting>` ← `reporting.enabled`. When `false`, skip every **Cost tick** step, the time-tracking variables and the session-cost line in the final report. When `true`, write the minimal report from `.github/skills/bass-reporting/SKILL.md` in Phase 7.

Print one line: `Config: base=<baseBranch>, tracker=<tracker>, report=<on|off>`.

## Agent architecture

Specialized work — BDD specification, architecture planning, JIRA ticket
management, and PR creation — runs as scoped sub-agents via the `Agent` tool.
Each sub-agent receives only the tools it needs and a self-contained prompt;
it returns a small JSON result block that the main agent uses to continue.

- **sdd-expert-agent** — domain expert in BDD specifications, writes
  exhaustive Gherkin specs using actor/action/outcome pattern
- **architect-agent** — expert in high-level architecture, software
  contracts (OpenAPI, DB entities, repository ports, DTOs, commands), and
  precise task decomposition into checkpoint-based execution plans
- **spec-reviewer** — verifies implementation matches BDD spec scenarios
- **design-reviewer** — verifies code quality against repo standards and rules
- **git-agent** — handles all git repository operations: branch creation,
  staging, committing, squashing, amending, syncing, and pushing
- **implementation-agent** — implements code changes: baseline verification,
  checkpoint-by-checkpoint development with build/test/lint/live-test loops,
  and review fix application

The main agent's job is to orchestrate: spawn sub-agents, pass context, and
route results. It does not touch tracker or repo MCP tools directly — those
belong to the sub-agents. It does not write code, run builds, or execute
tests — that belongs to the implementation-agent.

## Agent invocation contract

Every spawn uses the `Agent` tool with:

```
prompt      = <full contents of agents/<agent>.md> + "\n\nINPUT CONTEXT:\n" + <json>
allowedTools = the per-call tool list listed at each spawn site
```

When this document writes `→ spawn <agent>` with `action`, `input`, and `tools`
fields, that is shorthand for the full `Agent` tool call described above. Do not
invent extra `allowedTools` entries — use exactly the list shown. If no `tools`
line appears, the agent has unrestricted tool access.

When `gate=mcp`, wrap every spawn: call `mcp__bosch__agent_start` with
`{ name: "<agent>", op: "<action>" }` before the spawn, and
`mcp__bosch__agent_complete` with `{ name: "<agent>" }` after it returns.

When `gate=interactive`, omit all `mcp__bosch__*` wrapping.

---

## Error handling

The workflow is wrapped in a top-level error handler. Treat failures as either
**recoverable** (handled inside the iterate loop; do NOT touch ticket status)
or **non-recoverable** (must surface error and halt).

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| **Non-recoverable** | Configured transition name not found; ticket not found (when `<tracker>` is not `none`); network errors after retry; unhandled exception from any sub-agent |
| **Fallback (not an error)** | Tracker MCP unavailable or `<tracker>=none` -> continue with the ticket text the user gives; skip all tracker writes |
| **Recoverable** | Test failures; lint failures; design review pushback; spec review pushback; build failures |

Recoverable failures stay inside the existing iterate loops in Phases 3 and
5 — they do NOT bubble up to this error handler and do NOT touch ticket status.

On a non-recoverable failure:

2. Always surface the original error message to the user (include the error
   details and, for transition misses, the list of available transitions).
3. Always halt — do not attempt to continue the workflow.

If the failure transition is null: skip step 1 but still surface the error and halt.

---

## Halt mechanics

The Claude Code CLI pauses ONLY when the orchestrator (1) calls the harness pause tool
or (2) ends its turn — meaning no further tool calls and no further text in the
same response. Plain text output does NOT pause the CLI: the harness streams
text and immediately allows the next tool call. **Every later instruction in
this document using the words "prompt", "HALT", "wait for user", "halt and tell
the user", "wait for guidance", or `proceed` MUST be interpreted under this
rule.** When a phase says "halt" or "wait", that means: call the harness pause tool
where the response is an option from a small fixed set, OR print the prompt
and end the turn immediately. Do not call another tool, do not summarize, do
not "continue while waiting".

In `gate=mcp` mode, pauses are handled by `mcp__bosch__*` lifecycle calls. In `gate=interactive` mode, the pause tool is `AskUserQuestion`.

---

## Clarification autonomy

After configuration validation and before Phase 1-pre, prompt the user to
choose a clarification autonomy level. Read `config.clarify.defaultAutonomy`
from `config.json` (fallback `balanced` when the field is absent or invalid).

**If gate=mcp:** Call `mcp__bosch__clarify_request` with a single question: "Clarification autonomy" with options for each level (autopilot/balanced/guided/manual) and the config default pre-selected. The tool suspends until the user responds in the browser UI.

**If gate=interactive:** Use `AskUserQuestion` with the question
"Clarification autonomy: balanced — accept default or override?"
and options:

- `Accept default (balanced)`
- `a — autopilot`
- `b — balanced`
- `c — guided`
- `d — manual`

This is the primary mechanism — it is the only harness-enforced way to
pause for an enumerated choice.

**If `AskUserQuestion` is unavailable in the current context** (e.g., the
orchestrator is running under a sub-agent that does not expose it), print
the prompt line below verbatim and **end the turn immediately** — do not
call another tool, do not summarize, do not continue until the user has
replied. Text alone does NOT pause the CLI; see "Halt mechanics" above.

```
Clarification autonomy: balanced — accept [Enter] or override [a / b / c / d]?
```

Accept the response and hold the resolved level as `<autonomyLevel>` throughout
the entire workflow. Valid values and their one-letter codes:

| Code | Level | Behavior summary |
|------|-------|-----------------|
| `a` | `autopilot` | Skip Clarify (1a) entirely. Synthesis (1-syn) prints but does NOT block. Affected-repos auto-confirmed (workspace). All clarification dimensions accumulated as assumptions for the 1d gate. |
| `b` | `balanced` | 8-dimension enumeration rubric in 1a. Every `unclear` dimension becomes a question. Synthesis blocks for confirmation. |
| `c` | `guided` | 3-dimension direction-only rubric in 1a. Synthesis blocks for confirmation. Dimensions 4–8 deferred as gate assumptions. |
| `d` | `manual` | Free-form chat clarification in 1a; after each question batch the orchestrator MUST end the turn and wait — `proceed` is only reachable when the orchestrator has stopped calling tools (see "Halt mechanics"). Synthesis blocks for confirmation. |

**After the user responds**, print a one-line summary of the resolved level:

```
Clarification autonomy: autopilot — Clarify phase will be skipped; synthesis will print without blocking.
Clarification autonomy: balanced — Structured rubric; questions for every unclear dimension.
Clarification autonomy: guided — Direction questions only; lower-priority dimensions deferred to gate.
Clarification autonomy: manual — Free-form chat; type "proceed" when you're satisfied.
```

**No-persistence rule:** Per-invocation overrides do NOT modify `config.json`. The
next invocation re-prompts with the unchanged `config.clarify.defaultAutonomy`
value. To change the project default, the user edits `config.json` directly.

**No per-feature memory:** The orchestrator does NOT read or write any per-feature
autonomy state under `.claude/changes/<TICKET>/`. Autonomy is resolved fresh at
every invocation from the config default and the current-invocation override.

**Scope guardrail:** `<autonomyLevel>` gates only Phase 1-syn, 1a, and 1a-ws.
All other phases (2 through 7) and the 1d gate are UNAFFECTED — the gate always
fires regardless of autonomy level.

---

## Gate mode

Parse `--gate=<mode>` from the invocation message at workflow start (alongside `--autonomy`). Default: `interactive`.

| Mode | Gates | Clarification | Phase/Agent/Checkpoint lifecycle | Halts |
|------|-------|---------------|----------------------------------|-------|
| `mcp` | `mcp__bosch__gate_request` | `mcp__bosch__clarify_request` | `mcp__bosch__phase_start`, `phase_complete`, `agent_start`, `agent_complete`, `checkpoint_start`, `checkpoint_complete` | No halts — MCP tools suspend and resume the agent |
| `interactive` | `AskUserQuestion` / end-of-turn | `AskUserQuestion` | Omitted — no consumer for lifecycle signals | `AskUserQuestion` or end-of-turn |

**Hard contract — this is not a preference:**

- In `mcp` mode: NEVER use `AskUserQuestion`. NEVER end a turn to wait for user input. ALL gates and lifecycle signals go through `mcp__bosch__*` tools.
- In `interactive` mode: NEVER call any `mcp__bosch__*` tool. They do not exist in this environment.

Hold the resolved mode as `<gateMode>` throughout the entire workflow — resolved once at invocation, never re-parsed.

### Lifecycle signals (gate=mcp only)

When `gate=mcp`, emit lifecycle signals at the obvious structural boundaries:

| Signal | When | Payload |
|--------|------|---------|
| `phase_start` | Entry of each phase | `{ num, title }` (from phase heading) |
| `phase_complete` | Exit of each phase | `{ num }` |
| `agent_start` | Before every Agent spawn | `{ name, op }` (name from agent file, op from action) |
| `agent_complete` | After every Agent spawn returns | `{ name }` |
| `checkpoint_start` | Around each Phase 3 checkpoint (including baseline as `num: 0`) | `{ num, title }` |
| `checkpoint_complete` | After each Phase 3 checkpoint completes | `{ num }` |

When `gate=interactive`, omit all lifecycle signals entirely.

The `agent_start`/`agent_complete` wrapping is stated once in "Agent invocation
contract" above — it applies to every spawn site without inline reminders.

---

## Phase 1: Ticket, clarify, specify, and plan


This phase creates the JIRA ticket immediately, then produces two
deliverables before any code is written: a complete BDD specification and
a detailed technical execution plan. Both live in the `specs/` directory
and are committed with the feature — they are code, not throwaway notes.

### Time tracking

Record the workflow start time at the very beginning of Phase 1. This is
used to calculate work log durations later.

```bash
WORKFLOW_START=$(date +%s)
PHASE_1_START=$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)
SESSION_JSONL_PATH=~/.claude/projects/$(pwd | sed 's|/|-|g')/$CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID.jsonl
```

Hold `WORKFLOW_START` and `SESSION_JSONL_PATH` throughout the workflow. After Phase 1d, calculate the
elapsed time and log it. Record a second timestamp (`CHECKPOINT`) to
measure the implementation phase separately.

### 1-pre. Ticket setup

---

**Path A — user provided a ticket key:**

The ticket already exists. Infer the work area from the user's request
(`backend` | `frontend` | `devops` | `docs`) and hold it as `<area>`.

`<tracker>` usable: read the ticket (summary, description, acceptance criteria) with the tracker MCP tools (`bass-integrations` matrix). Transition / assign only if the user asks. Tell the user the ticket URL, then proceed to 1a.

`<tracker>=none`: ask the user to paste summary + acceptance criteria, keep their key as `ticketKey`, proceed to 1a.

---

**Path B — no ticket provided:** `<tracker>` usable -> create the ticket after 1d only if the user confirms; otherwise use `ticketKey = <project.ticketPrefix>-0000` (commitlint still needs a key) and say so.

### 1-syn. Stated synthesis

Before asking any clarification questions, externalize the orchestrator's
internal understanding of the feature by emitting a synthesis. This phase
always fires — for every autonomy level, for every ticket count.

**Context grounding (do before synthesizing):**

When any of the following files are present, read them before synthesizing:
- `CLAUDE.md` (project root; imports `.github/copilot-instructions.md`)
- The matching `.github/skills/*/SKILL.md` for the touched domain
- `.claude/memories/ecosystem.md` (or equivalent ecosystem memory file)
- (Workspace mode) Per-repo analysis reports under `.claude/reports/`

Use the project's documented architecture, vocabulary, and service topology to
ground the synthesis — name services that actually exist, flag "the ticket implies
X but no such service is documented." When none of these files exist, synthesize
from ticket text alone and note in the synthesis output: "No project context
available — synthesis based on ticket text only."

**Synthesis output shape:**

Emit a user-facing block with:

1. **2–3 paragraph plain-English summary** of the feature as the orchestrator
   understands it — purpose, expected behavior, and likely impact.
2. **Scope boundaries** (best-effort) — what is in scope and what is explicitly
   out of scope based on the ticket text and project context.
3. **(Multi-ticket input only)** **Proposed slicing** — a bullet list of how the
   orchestrator proposes to treat the tickets as one feature, with one-line
   justification per slice.

**Blocking behavior by autonomy level — branch on `<gateMode>`:**

**If `gate=mcp`:** The synthesis MUST be passed verbatim as the `context` field on the `clarify_request` question. Do NOT abbreviate or summarize — the user MUST see the full synthesis in the question card at confirmation time. Do NOT rely on the user reading the live stream; it is replaced by the InterviewPane once the gate opens.

| `<autonomyLevel>` | Behavior |
|-------------------|----------|
| `autopilot` | Print synthesis as informational output and continue immediately to 1a (which will be skipped). Do NOT wait for user input. |
| `balanced` | Call `mcp__bosch__clarify_request({ questions: [{ text: "Does this synthesis match your intent?", context: "<full synthesis markdown>" }] })`, then HALT (gate suspends until user responds). |
| `guided` | Call `mcp__bosch__clarify_request({ questions: [{ text: "Does this synthesis and slicing match your intent?", context: "<full synthesis markdown including proposed slicing>" }] })`, then HALT. For multi-ticket input, the blocking confirmation MUST cover BOTH the prose summary AND the proposed slicing in a single exchange — slicing is a direction-level decision and is NOT auto-accepted in guided mode. |
| `manual` | Call `mcp__bosch__clarify_request({ questions: [{ text: "Does this synthesis match your intent?", context: "<full synthesis markdown>" }] })`, then HALT (gate suspends until user responds). |

**If `gate=interactive`:** The synthesis is visible in the conversation scrollback; print-then-HALT is sufficient.

| `<autonomyLevel>` | Behavior |
|-------------------|----------|
| `autopilot` | Print synthesis as informational output and continue immediately to 1a (which will be skipped). Do NOT wait for user input. |
| `balanced` | Print synthesis, then HALT. Wait for user to respond with `confirm` or `correct: <feedback>`. |
| `guided` | Print synthesis, then HALT. For multi-ticket input, the blocking confirmation MUST cover BOTH the prose summary AND the proposed slicing in a single exchange — slicing is a direction-level decision and is NOT auto-accepted in guided mode. |
| `manual` | Print synthesis, then HALT. Wait for user `confirm` or `correct: <feedback>`. |

**HALT means (gate=mcp):** the `clarify_request` call itself suspends the agent — no end-of-turn needed. **HALT means (gate=interactive):** end the turn immediately after printing. Plain text does not pause the CLI; only end-of-turn does. This applies to every blocking row above and to all subsequent "wait for user" points.

**Correction loop (balanced / guided / manual):**

On `correct: <feedback>` or equivalent rejection:
- If the feedback is concrete and unambiguous: re-synthesize incorporating the feedback verbatim, then:
  - **gate=mcp:** call `mcp__bosch__clarify_request` again with the new synthesis as `context` on the next question, and re-block for confirmation. No upper limit on correction cycles.
  - **gate=interactive:** re-print the new synthesis, then HALT, re-blocking for `confirm` or `correct: <feedback>`. No upper limit on correction cycles.
- If the feedback is vague or has an ambiguous referent (e.g., "this is wrong"
  with no specifics, or feedback that could apply to multiple parts of the
  synthesis): ask ONE targeted clarifying question about the feedback BEFORE
  re-synthesizing. Do NOT guess and re-synthesize blindly.

**Hold** the confirmed (or autopilot-printed) synthesis as the orchestrator's
working understanding of the feature. Pass it to subsequent phases as the basis
for the BDD spec scope.

### 1a. Clarify scope

**Canonical clarification dimensions** (referenced by all autonomy-level subsections below):

1. Target repo
2. User-facing impact
3. Constraints and related tickets
4. Actors and roles
5. Error and edge cases
6. Authorization requirements
7. Integration/event boundaries
8. Input validation rules

Branch on `<autonomyLevel>`:

#### autopilot — skip

Skip 1a entirely. Proceed directly to 1b using the post-synthesis scope as
the clarified scope.

Accumulate all eight canonical clarification dimensions (listed above) as
"assumed from synthesis" entries for the 1d gate assumptions list.

Also treat the post-synthesis scope as the clarified scope for the ticket
description update step below.

#### balanced — 8-dimension enumeration rubric

Before asking any question, enumerate all eight dimensions from the canonical
list above and mark each:

```
1. <dimension>:   clear: <statement> | unclear: <what is missing>
...
8. <dimension>:   clear: <statement> | unclear: <what is missing>
```

Present the full rubric to the user (all eight lines with their `clear`/`unclear`
marks and explanatory statements). The user can push back on any dimension
marked `clear` that they believe needs clarification — treat a pushback as an
`unclear` and generate a question for it.

Every dimension marked `unclear` MUST become a question to the user. The
orchestrator MAY NOT proceed to 1b while any dimension remains `unclear`.

After the user answers, re-evaluate the rubric in light of the new information.
Any dimensions that remain `unclear` generate follow-up questions. Loop until
every dimension is `clear`.

#### guided — 3-dimension direction rubric

Before asking any question, enumerate the three direction-level dimensions:

```
1. Target repo:   clear: <statement> | unclear: <what is missing>
2. Change shape (new feature / refactor / bugfix / removal):  clear: <statement> | unclear: <what is missing>
3. Scope boundary (what's in, what's deferred):  clear: <statement> | unclear: <what is missing>
```

Present the full 3-dimension rubric to the user. The user can push back on
any `clear` mark — treat a pushback as an `unclear` and generate a question.

Every `unclear` MUST become a question. Loop until all three dimensions are
`clear`.

Defer dimensions 4–8 from the canonical list (actors, error cases,
authorization, integration boundaries, validation rules) to downstream agents
(`sdd-expert-agent`'s `openQuestions` and `architect-agent`'s `risks`).
Accumulate deferred dimensions 4–8 as "assumed from ticket text" entries for
the 1d gate assumptions list.

#### manual — free-form chat

Ask the user about all eight canonical clarification dimensions (listed above)
in conversation form:

1. Which repo is this for?
2. Is there a user-facing impact, or is it internal/infra?
3. Any known constraints or related tickets?
4. Who are the actors? What are their roles and permissions?
5. What are the error and edge cases?
6. Are there authorization requirements?
7. Are there event/integration boundaries (e.g., cross-service calls)?
8. What validation rules apply to inputs?

Ask follow-up questions as needed. Do NOT proceed to 1b until the user
responds with `proceed` (or an equivalent affirmative like "done", "that's
everything", "move on"). Free-form chat continues across as many exchanges
as needed.

---

**After scope is fully clarified** (or skipped in autopilot), update the
ticket description — but only if it needs updating:

- **Newly created ticket** (`existingDescription` is `false`): always
  update — refine the initial description with the fully clarified scope.
- **Existing ticket with thin/missing description** (`existingDescription`
  is `false`): update with the clarified scope.
- **Existing ticket with well-populated description** (`existingDescription`
  is `true`): skip the description update — the ticket is already
  well-described.

### 1b. Create the BDD spec

Once scope is fully clear, determine the spec directory, then delegate to
the SDD Expert sub-agent.

**Directory naming:**

Determine the next sequence number by inspecting existing directories:

```bash
ls -d specs/[0-9]* 2>/dev/null | sort -n | tail -1
```

If none exist, start at `001`. Otherwise increment the highest number by 1,
zero-padded to 3 digits. Use `ticketKey` from Phase 1-pre. The directory
name follows this pattern:

```
specs/<NNN>-<TICKET>-<short-slug>/
```

Example: `specs/001-PTBASS-12345-short-description/`

**Delegate to sdd-expert-agent:**

Read the agent instructions from
`.claude/skills/feature-workflow/agents/sdd-expert-agent.md`, then spawn
the agent:

→ spawn sdd-expert-agent
  input:   { scope: "<clarified scope from 1a>",
             specDir: "specs/<NNN>-<TICKET>-<slug>/",
             service: "<repo name and path>",
             actors: ["<actor 1 and role>", "<actor 2 and role>"],
             constraints: "<known constraints, related tickets, edge cases>",
             area: "<BE | FE | DevOps | Docs>" }

The agent will emit a JSON result block. Extract and hold for Phase 1c:

```json
{
  "specDir": "specs/001-PTBASS-12345-short-description/",
  "specFiles": ["business-behavior-spec.md", "authorization-spec.md"],
  "scenarioCount": 15,
  "concerns": ["business-behavior", "authorization"],
  "openQuestions": []
}
```

If `openQuestions` is non-empty, present them to the user and resolve
before proceeding. Do not continue to 1c with unresolved ambiguities.

### 1c. Create the technical execution plan

After the spec is complete, delegate to the Architect sub-agent to produce
the execution plan.

**Delegate to architect-agent:**

Read the agent instructions from
`.claude/skills/feature-workflow/agents/architect-agent.md`, then spawn
the agent:

→ spawn architect-agent
  input:   { specDir: "specs/<NNN>-<TICKET>-<slug>/",
             service: "<repo name and path>",
             area: "<BE | FE | DevOps | Docs>",
             specFiles: <specFiles array from sdd-expert-agent result> }

The agent will emit a JSON result block:

```json
{
  "planPath": "specs/001-PTBASS-12345-short-description/execution-plan.md",
  "checkpointCount": 4,
  "taskCount": 12,
  "layersAffected": ["domain", "application", "adapter-in", "adapter-out"],
  "contractsDefined": ["rest-api", "domain-model", "db-entity", "repository-port", "command", "authorization"],
  "risks": []
}
```

If `risks` is non-empty, include them in the gate presentation (1d) so the
user can acknowledge or resolve them.

### 1d. Gate — spec and plan review

**Construct the `assumptions` field before calling the gate:**

The `assumptions` field is a markdown-formatted string listing every
clarification decision the orchestrator made without explicit user input.
Accumulate entries across Phase 1-syn, 1a, and 1a-ws:

| `<autonomyLevel>` | What to accumulate |
|-------------------|--------------------|
| `autopilot` | All 8 clarification dimensions ("assumed from synthesis"), plus any workspace-repo auto-confirmations. One bullet per item. |
| `guided` | Deferred dimensions 4–8 ("assumed from ticket text"), plus any workspace-repo auto-confirmations. |
| `balanced` | Only inferred decisions the user did NOT explicitly correct during synthesis or 1a clarification. Typically empty or near-empty. |
| `manual` | Only inferred decisions the user did NOT explicitly provide. Typically empty. |

When nothing was inferred without user input, `assumptions` MAY be an empty
string or contain only `"No assumptions made — every decision was user-directed."`.

**Request human approval:**

Read the full text of all spec files in `specDir` and the execution plan.

**If gate=mcp:** Call `mcp__bosch__gate_request` with:

```
{
  "kind": "spec+plan",
  "payload": {
    "ticket": "<ticketKey>",
    "spec": "<full text of all BDD spec files from specDir, concatenated>",
    "plan": "<full text of execution-plan.md>",
    "assumptions": "<markdown bullet list of inferred decisions, or empty string>"
  }
}
```

The tool suspends the workflow and delivers the spec + plan to the bosch web UI
for human review. It returns only when the user resolves the gate.

**If gate=interactive:** Present the spec and plan summary to the user. Use
`AskUserQuestion` with options: "Approve", "Revise". If `AskUserQuestion` is
unavailable, print the summary and end the turn — wait for the user to respond
with `approve` or specific revision feedback.

**Branch on the gate result:**

**If result is `"approved"` (or user responds `approve` in interactive mode):** proceed to time-logging below, then Phase 2.

**If result is `{ status: "rejected", changes: "<feedback>" }` (gate=mcp) or user requests revisions (gate=interactive):**

1. Re-invoke sdd-expert-agent with the change request injected as additional context:

→ spawn sdd-expert-agent
  input:   { scope: "<original clarified scope from 1a>",
             specDir: "specs/<NNN>-<TICKET>-<slug>/",
             service: "<service name and path>",
             actors: ["<actors from 1a>"],
             constraints: "<constraints from 1a>",
             area: "<area>",
             revisionRequest: "<changes value from gate result — pass verbatim>" }
  tools:   [Read, Edit, Write, Bash]

2. Re-invoke architect-agent with the updated spec and the same change request:

→ spawn architect-agent
  input:   { specDir: "specs/<NNN>-<TICKET>-<slug>/",
             service: "<service name and path>",
             area: "<area>",
             specFiles: <updated specFiles array from sdd-expert result>,
             revisionRequest: "<changes value from gate result — pass verbatim>" }
  tools:   [Read, Write, Bash]

3. Re-issue the gate:
   - **If gate=mcp:** Call `mcp__bosch__gate_request` with the updated spec and plan payload.
   - **If gate=interactive:** Re-present the updated spec and plan via `AskUserQuestion` (or end-of-turn if unavailable).
   Repeat the reject-branch loop until the result is `"approved"` (or user approves).

**After the gate is approved**, log the requirement refinement work and record
the checkpoint timestamp before proceeding autonomously.

Calculate elapsed time since workflow start:

```bash
PHASE1_END=$(date +%s)
ELAPSED_SECONDS=$((PHASE1_END - WORKFLOW_START))
```

Convert `ELAPSED_SECONDS` to JIRA time format (e.g., `"1h 30m"`, `"45m"`,
`"2h"`). Round to the nearest 5 minutes. Use hours and minutes — do not
use seconds or days.

Once confirmed, execute Phases 2–7 autonomously without pausing.


Record Phase 1 spawn counts in the SPAWN_LOG context memo:

```
SPAWN_LOG:
  phase1: sdd-expert×1, architect×1
```

### 1-end. Cost tick → see references/cost-tick.md (label="Spec+Plan", since=PHASE_1_START)

Record: `PHASE_2_START=$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)`

---

## Phase 2: Create branch


Use `ticketKey` from Phase 1. Derive a short kebab-case slug from the
ticket summary (3-5 words, no area prefix). Do not ask the user.

Branch naming follows `git.branchPattern` from config — by default
`{type}/{ticket}-{slug}` where `{type}` is one of `git.branchTypes`
(default `feature`, `bugfix`, `hotfix`) and `{ticket}` is the full
`<ticketKey>` (e.g., `<projectKey>-12345`).

Example with default config: `feature/<projectKey>-12345-short-description`

Delegate to the git sub-agent. Read the agent instructions from
`.claude/skills/feature-workflow/agents/git-agent.md`, then spawn
the agent:

→ spawn git-agent
  action:  "create-branch"
  input:   { branchName: "feature/<projectKey>-XXXXX-short-description" }
  tools:   [Bash]

The agent will emit a JSON result block:

```json
{
  "action": "create-branch",
  "branch": "feature/<projectKey>-XXXXX-short-description"
}
```


Append to the SPAWN_LOG:
```
  phase2: git-agent×1
```

### 2-end. Cost tick → see references/cost-tick.md (label="Branch", since=PHASE_2_START)

Record: `PHASE_3_START=$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)`

---

## Phase 3: Develop and test


All implementation work is delegated to the implementation-agent. Read the
agent instructions from
`.claude/skills/feature-workflow/agents/implementation-agent.md` once and
reuse for all spawns in this phase.

### 3a. Baseline and checkpoint 1 — in parallel


Launch both the baseline verification and checkpoint 1 simultaneously.
Send them in a **single message with two Agent tool calls**, both with
`run_in_background: true`:

→ spawn implementation-agent  [background]
  input:   { action: "baseline", service: "<repo name and path>",
             area: "<BE | FE>" }
  tools:   [Read, Edit, Write, Bash]

→ spawn implementation-agent  [background]
  action:  "checkpoint"
  input:   { executionPlanPath: "specs/<NNN>-<TICKET>-<slug>/execution-plan.md",
             checkpointNumber: 1,
             specDir: "specs/<NNN>-<TICKET>-<slug>/",
             service: "<repo name and path>",
             area: "<BE | FE>" }
  tools:   [Read, Edit, Write, Bash]

Wait for both to complete.

**If baseline fails (`passed: false`):** Stop the entire workflow
immediately. Tell the user the baseline is broken (compilation or boot
failure), include the `failureDetails` from the result, and ask them to
fix the issues before re-invoking the workflow. Any checkpoint 1 work
done in parallel is discarded — the branch can be deleted and recreated.
Do NOT proceed with further checkpoints.

**If baseline passes:** Continue with checkpoint 1's result. If checkpoint 1
also completed successfully, proceed to checkpoint 2. If checkpoint 1 hit a
blocker, present it to the user.

### 3b. Remaining checkpoints

For each remaining checkpoint (2 to N) in the execution plan, spawn the implementation-agent sequentially:

→ spawn implementation-agent
  action:  "checkpoint"
  input:   { executionPlanPath: "specs/<NNN>-<TICKET>-<slug>/execution-plan.md",
             checkpointNumber: <N>,
             specDir: "specs/<NNN>-<TICKET>-<slug>/",
             service: "<repo name and path>",
             area: "<BE | FE>" }
  tools:   [Read, Edit, Write, Bash]

**If `completed` is `false`:** the agent hit a blocker. Present the
`blocker` description to the user and **end the turn** — wait for the
user's guidance before retrying or proceeding (no further tool calls in
the same response; see "Halt mechanics").

**After each checkpoint:** aggregate `testsRun`, `testsPassed`, and
`liveTestResults` from the result into a cumulative test summary. This
summary is passed to the PR agent in Phase 6.

Only proceed to Phase 4 when **all checkpoints are complete** and every
scenario in the BDD spec is satisfied.


Append to the SPAWN_LOG with actual spawn counts:
```
  phase3: impl-agent×N (baseline×1, CP×<checkpoint_count>)
```
where N = 1 (baseline) + number of checkpoints completed.

### 3-end. Cost tick → see references/cost-tick.md (label="Implement", since=PHASE_3_START)

Record: `PHASE_4_START=$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)`

---

## Phase 4: Commit


One commit per branch. If multiple commits accumulated during Phase 3, squash
them first. The commit message must be prefixed with `ticketKey` from Phase 1.

All git operations in this phase are delegated to the git sub-agent. Read the
agent instructions from `.claude/skills/feature-workflow/agents/git-agent.md`
once and reuse for all spawns in this phase.

**Important:** The spec directory (`specs/<NNN>-PTBASS-XXXXX-slug/`) is code and
must be included in the commit. Pass it as `specDir` to `stage-and-prepare`.

### 4a. Check commit count

→ spawn git-agent
  action:  "count-commits"
  tools:   [Bash]

Extract `commitCount`:
- If **1 commit**: skip to Step 4c
- If **> 1 commits**: run the squash flow (Steps 4b then 4c)
- If **0 commits**: something went wrong in Phase 3 — check staging

### 4b. Squash (only if > 1 commit)

Spawn the git-agent with the `squash` action. The agent runs
`prepare-squash.sh`, creates a backup branch, and does a soft-reset to the
detected main branch. If the rebase encounters conflicts, the agent
reports an error — stop and tell the user to resolve manually.

→ spawn git-agent
  action:  "squash"
  tools:   [Bash]

Extract `combinedDiff` and `backupBranch` from the result.

Use the `combinedDiff` to compose the commit message (Step 4c format), then
spawn the git-agent with the `commit` action (see 4c below).

After committing, verify the squash integrity:

→ spawn git-agent
  action:  "verify-squash"
  input:   { backupBranch: "<backupBranch from squash result>" }
  tools:   [Bash]

If `verified` is `false`, stop and tell the user. Include the recovery
command from the error result.

### 4c. Stage and commit

**Stage:**

→ spawn git-agent
  action:  "stage-and-prepare"
  input:   { specDir: "specs/<NNN>-PTBASS-XXXXX-slug/" }
  tools:   [Bash]

**Compose the commit message:**

```
<TICKET>: <message>

<description_block>
```

**Message line**: imperative mood, ≤50 chars after the ticket prefix.
**Description block**: explain why and what; wrap at 72 chars; group changes
under headings when the diff spans multiple areas.

**Commit:**

→ spawn git-agent
  action:  "commit"
  input:   { message: "<full commit message>" }
  tools:   [Bash]

After committing, collect the final commit message (first line + body) — you
will pass this to the PR agent in Phase 6.


Append to the SPAWN_LOG with actual spawn counts:
```
  phase4: git-agent×<N>
```
where N is the actual number of git-agent spawns used for committing.

### 4-end. Cost tick → see references/cost-tick.md (label="Commit", since=PHASE_4_START)

Record: `PHASE_5_START=$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)`

---

## Phase 5: Review


Two automated review gates verify the implementation before creating the PR.
Both reviewers are read-only — they report findings, and the
implementation-agent applies fixes.

### 5a. Spec review

First, get the list of changed files:

→ spawn git-agent
  action:  "get-changed-files"
  tools:   [Bash]

Then spawn the spec-reviewer. Read agent instructions from
`.claude/skills/feature-workflow/agents/spec-reviewer.md`:

→ spawn spec-reviewer
  input:   { specDir: "specs/<NNN>-<TICKET>-<slug>/",
             service: "<repo name and path>",
             changedFiles: <changedFiles array from git-agent>,
             area: "<BE | FE>" }
  tools:   [Read, Bash]

**If `passed` is `false`** (Critical findings):

1. Spawn the implementation-agent with `fix-findings`:

→ spawn implementation-agent
  action:  "fix-findings"
  input:   { findings: <Critical + Major findings from spec-reviewer>,
             reviewerType: "spec",
             service: "<repo name and path>",
             area: "<BE | FE>" }
  tools:   [Read, Edit, Write, Bash]

2. Amend the commit:

→ spawn git-agent
  action:  "amend"
  tools:   [Bash]

3. Re-run the spec-reviewer to verify fixes resolved the Critical findings.

If still failing after one fix cycle, present the remaining findings to the
user and ask for guidance.

### 5b. Design review


Spawn the design-reviewer. Read agent instructions from
`.claude/skills/feature-workflow/agents/design-reviewer.md`:

→ spawn design-reviewer
  input:   { service: "<repo name and path>",
             changedFiles: <changedFiles array from git-agent>,
             area: "<BE | FE>" }
  tools:   [Read, Bash]

**If `passed` is `false`** (Critical findings): follow the same
fix → amend → re-review loop as 5a, using `"reviewerType": "design"`.



Append to the SPAWN_LOG with actual spawn counts:
```
  phase5: spec-reviewer×<N>, design-reviewer×<N>
```
where N is the actual number of spawns (0 if that reviewer was skipped).

### 5-end. Cost tick → see references/cost-tick.md (label="Review", since=PHASE_5_START)

Record: `PHASE_6_START=$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)`

---

## Phase 6: Push and PR (only on user request)

Never push by default. When the user asks:

→ spawn git-agent
  action:  "sync-and-push"
  input:   { branch: "<branch>" }
  tools:   [Bash]

Then open the PR with whatever is available: GitHub MCP / `gh` (GitHub) or Azure DevOps MCP (`azureDevOps.enabled`). PR body = summary from Phase 3 + spec dir link + checks result. No tool available -> print the compare URL and the body for the user to paste.

---

## Phase 7: Finalize


### Final report to user

After Phase 7 completes, tell the user:
- The PR URL
- A brief summary of what was implemented
- Test results (from the test summary built in Phase 3)
- The actual session cost (only when `<reporting>` is on)
- A reminder to request reviewers if needed

| 1c Plan | **architect** (Sonnet) | Write `execution-plan.md` with checkpoints and contracts | Acknowledge risks |
| 1d Review | Main (Sonnet) | Present spec + plan to user | **User confirms** ← only gate |
| 2 Branch | **git-agent** (Haiku) | `git checkout -b feature/<projectKey>-X-slug` | — |
| 3a Baseline + CP1 | **impl-agent** (Sonnet) ×2 | Compile+boot check ‖ first checkpoint (parallel) | Stop if baseline fails |
| 3b Checkpoints | **impl-agent** (Sonnet) | Remaining checkpoints sequentially | — |
| 4 Commit | **git-agent** (Haiku) | Squash → stage → commit | — |
| 5a Spec review | **spec-reviewer** (Sonnet) | Verify all BDD scenarios implemented + tested | Fix Critical findings |
| 5b Design review | **design-reviewer** (Sonnet) | Verify code quality against project rules | Fix Critical findings |

## What this is NOT

- Not for experiments or spikes — those just get coded, no ticket needed
- Not for quick fixes with no PR — commit directly without this workflow
- The ticket documents the **goal**, not the solution — implementation details
  belong in the commit message and PR description, written after the work
